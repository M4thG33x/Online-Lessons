        <h2 id="top">GeoGebra</h2>

        <p>We can graph vector-valued functions in <a title="GeoGebra Classic 3D" href="https://www.geogebra.org/classic#3d" target="_blank">GeoGebra Classic 3D (new window)</a> [https://www.geogebra.org/classic#3d] using the Curve command. There are several
            variations of this command, but the format we will use is stated below.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>curve((x(t), y(t), z(t)), t, a, b)</strong></p>

        <p>For this command, the variables <b>x</b>, <b>y</b>, and <b>z</b> are the component functions, <b>t</b> is the parameter, and <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are the interval of <b>t</b> we want to graph. Be sure to include the extra parenthesis around the
            component functions to make it a vector function. Here are a few examples. The first expression represents the line that we briefly discussed in the previous lesson.</p>

        <img src="GeoGebra-Curves.png" alt="Graph of vector functions in GeoGebra using the CURVE command." />

        <p>Try graphing the two functions that were illustrated in the GeoGebra applets on the Curves page, \(\vec{r}(t) = \langle \sin{t}, t, \frac{t^2}{4} \rangle \) and \(\vec{r}(t) = \langle 4\cos{t}, \sin{t}, \frac{t}{2} \rangle \). Do your curves match
            what the curves looked like in the applets?</p>

        <p>You can also use <a title="GeoGebra Classic CAS" href="https://www.geogebra.org/classic#cas" target="_blank">GeoGebra Classic CAS (new window)</a> [https://www.geogebra.org/classic#cas] to evaluate derivatives and integrals. The command for evaluating
            derivatives is as follows.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Derivative(expression, variable, number)</strong>.</p>

        <p>Note that you must enter an <b>expression</b> or function. A vector function is acceptable, just put all the components in a parenthesis. The <b>variable</b> input is optional, unless you want to put a value in for the <b>number</b>. It represents
            the variable in your function that you want to take the derivatie with respect to, usually <em>x</em> or in our examples it is <em>t</em>. The <b>number</b> input is to find higher-order derivatives, so for example putting 2 in for the <b>number</b>            would find the 2<sup>nd</sup> derivative. An alternate method is to nest derivative commands within each other, so "derivative(derivative(f(x),x))" would also return the 2<sup>nd</sup> derivative.</p>

        <p>Similarly, the command for evaluating integrals is stated below.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Integral(function, variable, start, end)</strong>.</p>

        <p>You must enter a <b>function</b>, and it cannot be a vector. So integrating a vector would require typing an integral command for each component. If your function is a function of <em>x</em>, then the <b>variable</b> input is optional. If using
            any other letter, such as <em>t</em>, then you must enter that letter. The <b>start</b> and <b>end</b> inputs represent the <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> values of a definite integral. If you do not include these, then you will just get the indefinite
            integral (antiderivative).</p>

        <p>In the image below, line (1) represents the basic derivative command. Notice the <b>variable</b> input is not included. Lines (2) and (3) represent different commands to get the 2<sup>nd</sup> derivative. Line (4) illustrates the Scalar Product
            Rule. Lines (5) through (7) show how to get the indefinite integral for the vector function \(\vec{r}(t) = \langle t \, \sin(t^2), -20 e^{-5t}, \frac{5}{t} \rangle \). Notice that a command is required for each component and an arbitrary constant
            is included. Also note that <b>ln(<em>e</em>)</b> = 1. Sometimes weird expressions like this may result depending on the algorithm used by GeoGebra. Similar behavior can result from other algebra systems. Lastly, line (8) represents the definite
            integral of the function \(f(t) = t \, \sin(t^2) \) from <strong>start</strong> = 0 to <strong>end</strong> = 2<em>&pi;</em>. GeoGebra will reformat the "integral" commands from the input text expression to the symbolic expression you see
            in the image.</p>

        <img src="GeoGebraDerivInt.png" alt="Image illustrating various derivative and integral commands in GeoGebra." />

        <p>Note that as you start typing the words "derivative" or "integral" you will see variations of the above commands appear. Feel free to use whichever you want. The instructions above just illustrate the most general versions.</p>

        <p>Also, the CAS feature is a little wonky at times. Sometimes trying to delete part of an expression will delete the whole line. Usually copy-and-paste doesn't work well either.</p>

        <p>Lastly, you are welcome to use other resources to evaluate derivatives and integrals (and any other computations required for this course). Many students find <a title="Wolfram Alpha" href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/" target="_blank">Wolfram Alpha (new window)</a>            [https://www.wolframalpha.com/ and <a title="Symbolab" href="https://www.symbolab.com/" target="_blank">Symbolab (new window)</a> [https://www.symbolab.com/] to be helpful as well. All of these resources have their own strengths and weaknesses.
            Just remember that you will <strong>not</strong> be able to use these resources on tests. Only a scientific calculator like the TI-36x will be allowed (it will do numerical derivatives and integrals).</p>
